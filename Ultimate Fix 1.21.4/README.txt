"Ultimate Fix" datapack works best on Vanilla 1.21.4

- The "Ultimate Fix" datapack is a collection of 6 smaller patches.
  If you want to include only some of them, import all datapacks from
  the "separated fixes" folder.

- While updating your world to newer versions ALWAYS make
  a backup, because no one knows, what Mojang will change when it
  comes to datapack compatibility.
