# Minecraft-Modern-Fix
 Datapack for modern Minecraft versions to balance and improve gameplay experience.

- The "Ultimate Fix" datapack is a collection of 7 smaller patches.
  If you want to include only some of them, import these datapacks from
  the "separated fixes" folder. See datapack changelog in the "documentation.txt"
  file in the proper datapack directory, for example "Ultimate Fix 1.21.4".

- It is recommended to stay on the datapack after it is imported, but
  do as you want. The only problem, which may appear after disabling
  datapack is that chests on end ships, which has been loaded, but not
  opened yet will delete their loot. It comes from the phantom fix.

```warning
- While updating your world to newer versions ALWAYS make
  a backup, because no one knows, what Mojang will change when it
  comes to datapack compatibility.
